      "Transcript:   Every time I dial the feet of boss my character will change to a random enemy from Elden Ring I'm gonna try and beat the game and see how difficult or easier it is Alright, um, we're here and we started as a blive pretty good I don't know what he can do, but we actually have a good chance to be able to defeat a boss so I can swing the blade and then Oh Okay, all right, we're moving out boys. Let's start with one of these Okay, oh dude, we are washing him. This is crazy dude, we're washing him Oh, there we go. Okay, no, we're cooking boys. I'm kind of worried that like we'll beat the first boss And then we'll transform into like the worst character in this man I still feel like there's gonna be some bosses that are gonna give us some trouble just because I don't know how it's gonna go All right boys It's almost time. Uh something tells me we don't need to summon anyone in for this right? Okay, what you got, bro? Let me let me start off with one of these Bunk Ah, this is fine. Wait, let's finish him with a big move That's what I thought, bro That's what I thought first boss defeated this hit a grace and see what happens. Give me something good Uh, all right, God's you know, Possible. Is that better than what we had? This is this I'm sprinting. I'm currently sprinting. Okay Oh, wait, that's kind of crap and then I assume he can throw one of them fireballs Oh, he does way more than that What's up, bro? What's up now? What's up? What you got? I do something try something do you worse? Do try something, bro Just try something I dare you bro. I dare you yet. I didn't think so don't do it, bro Don't do it. Oh my god Uh, okay, what's up? What's up? You ain't got police like me son You ain't got a police like me, bro. What's up, bro? Hit him with one of these Oh, he's actually he's kind of mission there But Oh, shush. He kind of did half my health which makes me kind of scared for god's right, but I'm sure it would be fine All right boys, here's our time. Let's see if we can do it. How do we how do we approach? I say we go for a jump Shoot bunk Real run boys Exound we just bat bat bat bat bat bat. Okay. We evacuate from this as fast as my guy Walk all right now jump with it. That was huge one more Oh Okay, if we get someone weaker than this guy This is gonna be a challenge, bro. If we get somebody crazy, it's gonna be easy. All right. I said a grace I see here we get okay so early on too. He's got a jump attack dude. Look at the way he's swinging, bro He's got kicks. I No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is bunkers. Who's our who's next on our boss list, bro? I think we're gonna try beat redone I think we need the academy key or whatever it is to get in Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to do that. Oh, all right. Let's test this out, bro. What can he do? Dude, he's just smacking him. You don't want none of this, bro Oh my god, I can actually take him in the air After making the long journey to K-Lid, I finally made it to Bore's where redone was. All right. I'm on the way I'm on the way if I die and then end up as like another much worse character It's not it's not gonna be looking good. He's gonna shoot the arrows Oh dude, I ducked. I don't literally ducked under that arrow. Okay Dodge, ow. All right, jump for him. Jump for him But but oh Okay, okay, I ran into it. I ran into it boys. Oh, that's that's a lot of damage. That's a lot of damage back up back up back up He's coming for me, bro. He knows he knows who the threat is. Uh-oh. Okay. All right phase one is done Um This is fine. I'm gonna revive and I'm gonna be somebody even better. All right, whatever. Let's see. Let's just see what it is. Okay I mean it's not really the best Can he do can he do the thing? Okay I think we might be losing this guy pretty soon, but well we'll give it a go, bro We'll give it a go. Boys all we can do is hope this guy does a lot of damage for some reason use the thing Use the thing Okay go I don't have a dodge every time I dodge he does he does the attack Um, oh Why did I do that? I mean I have the shield the shield actually seems it pretty good honestly It could be worse. Oh, he seems to kind of be cheesy in a bit by staying in between his legs I just need you to not get hit by that I Almost jumped directly into it. The thing do the thing do the thing Shields. Oh my god. Yes More of that please now. Did this is bonkers go. Oh Oh my god All right, let's see who we get a no-way, bro. Wait, we about to have a mirror match. Does this take up mana or no? It seems like we have infinite mana to be honest. All right bro, what's up? What's up? Okay, that's good damage. I'm literally you don't want to mage that all bro. All right, uh Bing bling bling bling bling bling and then This spinning weapons actually kind of sick and we're just gonna spread straight the whole way wait I've just learned some tech But if I go like bang bang we start TP and bro. Yeah, what's good, bro? Zap zap zap zap okay, there wasn't too much damage yet. We're kind of rocking him Go go go go he's on me. He's eating me. He's eating me Okay, he used to use this use this use the spinny blade thing Um never mind I guess oh That was a boss do we get around him go apparently not I don't know if it bugged or it just doesn't count him as A main boss, but that's that's kind of that makes sense I guess all right. Let's roll out. Um me v me Let's go all right hit him with the thing The wise is harder than it normally is make just kill him all at this point like oh Okay, lock on to her. No the boss Oh, this is the worst okay, that was that was huge. I'm actually get it off that time. All right. There should be it There should be it. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. Let's face one Um Okay rough start. This is kind of sick though The wizard battle popping off. Oh, I would have dodged that personally Up to you though. I guess let's try one of these. Oh, I'm right in the middle of that. Yeah. All right. Let's hope that hits her Okay, it did uh go go go spells That's bad. That's bad. That was bad. That was bad. Oh Oh my god Okay, she just took it to the chest Jesus for a second. I was kind of worried. That was kind of sick though, but I'm glad we got run out early Because she was not kind of stand up to the likes of uh Some bosses coming up. All right. Let's see who we get another boss defeated bell bearing hunter Yeah Okay, I don't know how strong this is going to be, but we do look kind of we look kind of good. All right, so this guy can swing He can Do this It looks a little buggy Um But it's it's pretty there's pretty cool. I think we're gonna go through the ravine. All right run pass that guy And then we go up this we are so large. I do not want to fall off. All right. Let's give this a go Oh, there he is. Oh, okay Okay, okay, how much damage are we doing? We're doing an okay amount. All right and go That was huge. I think that's what makes us so strong is this guy is just the fact that we uh Knock him down over and over That is what's up. Uh, let's see if that counts as a boss Apparently not all right. We'll keep it rolling. I just keep it pushing boys. Uh, no. Thank you. No. Thank you. No. Thank you I'm not dealing with that. All right. Let's charge up one of these Okay We got the stack. He's just got health on health though easy dodge Not so easy dodge. Oh, I hate this guy. I hate this guy. I think we can easily get another knock He will heal That was a little embarrassing that if we get a character that's even worse. I We might be cooked we might be finished Okay Oh, it's omen king as well. So he got the He got the blade on him so I can just keep spamming that and he'll just he'll just go He'll just go silly with it if I just keep going. I just get a revenge. Yo, what's up now then Bunk, bunk, bunk, bunk, bunk, bunk, bunk, hammer Finish him All right, we are we are in the source boys Boys, we're in the source. Let's go. We're gonna start with One of these I missed. Oh, oh, dude. We stagger him so easily. This is actually bonkers Worse his bonkers is he weak to like the type of damage I do though try it, bro. Just don't try it, bro And then we jump in the air dodge that hit him down with one of these. Yeah, nah dude. This is this is cernz This is cernz dude. I actually thought this guy was gonna be a challenge, bro Bunk He's dead. That was insane. I'm gonna lose him now on I kiss. He was a boss. We only got some play with him for like five minutes Um, I guess I didn't even know dragons were in this Can I move? Sort of okay. Well, this is well and good I So I can breathe fire Okay Yep, this works bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro What am I meant to do dude? I'll I'll see it this sucks. Oh Okay, dude, this is this is this is done. This is so dumb Um, I'm not getting through it's been so difficult to like maneuver myself a shame that I could oh my god You know use it on him, bro We miss like this guy is not fitting in the boss room. Okay. I think it was you meant to go this way I don't I don't know how we're gonna be able to do this. I May have to just kill myself to get a different Mob okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is I can't play this bro. Okay Jump up bro every time he jumps he goes backwards a little bit. Oh Close oh no Where am I this is not working? I like I'm not getting up through that bro. All right boys boys. I like the dragon But I'm gonna have to let these dudes kill me because we just We can't do this Oh Okay, let's see who we get next. There's a bunch more dragons we could get which would be very funny Um, okay We are we got like the blood oh one of the black knife assassins Jesus oh my god And then we can do that all right all right um down this way All right this way this way this way Uh, oh get away from me bro.

       "\" Every time I dial the feet of boss my character will change to a random enemy from Elden Ring I'm gonna try and beat the game and see how difficult or easier it is Alright, um, we're here and we started as a blive pretty good I don't know what he can do, but we actually have a good chance to be able to defeat a boss so I can swing the blade and then Oh Okay, all right, we're moving out boys. Let's start with one of these Okay, oh dude, we are washing him. This is crazy dude, we're washing him Oh, there we go. Okay, no, we're cooking boys. I'm kind of worried that like we'll beat the first boss And then we'll transform into like the worst character in this man I still feel like there's gonna be some bosses that are gonna give us some trouble just because I don't know how it's gonna go All right boys It's almost time. Uh something tells me we don't need to summon anyone in for this right? Okay, what you got, bro? Let me let me start off with one of these Bunk Ah, this is fine. Wait, let's finish him with a big move That's what I thought, bro That's what I thought first boss defeated this hit a grace and see what happens. Give me something good Uh, all right, God's you know, Possible. Is that better than what we had? This is this I'm sprinting. I'm currently sprinting. Okay Oh, wait, that's kind of crap and then I assume he can throw one of them fireballs Oh, he does way more than that What's up, bro? What's up now? What's up? What you got? I do something try something do you worse? Do try something, bro Just try something I dare you bro. I dare you yet. I didn't think so don't do it, bro Don't do it. Oh my god Uh, okay, what's up? What's up? You ain't got police like me son You ain't got a police like me, bro. What's up, bro? Hit him with one of these Oh, he's actually he's kind of mission there But Oh, shush. He kind of did half my health which makes me kind of scared for god's right, but I'm sure it would be fine All right boys, here's our time. Let's see if we can do it. How do we how do we approach? I say we go for a jump Shoot bunk Real run boys Exound we just bat bat bat bat bat bat. Okay. We evacuate from this as fast as my guy Walk all right now jump with it. That was huge one more Oh Okay, if we get someone weaker than this guy This is gonna be a challenge, bro. If we get somebody crazy, it's gonna be easy. All right. I said a grace I see here we get okay so early on too. He's got a jump attack dude. Look at the way he's swinging, bro He's got kicks. I No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is bunkers. Who's our who's next on our boss list, bro? I think we're gonna try beat redone I think we need the academy key or whatever it is to get in Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to do that. Oh, all right. Let's test this out, bro. What can he do? Dude, he's just smacking him. You don't want none of this, bro Oh my god, I can actually take him in the air After making the long journey to K-Lid, I finally made it to Bore's where redone was. All right. I'm on the way I'm on the way if I die and then end up as like another much worse character It's not it's not gonna be looking good. He's gonna shoot the arrows Oh dude, I ducked. I don't literally ducked under that arrow. Okay Dodge, ow. All right, jump for him. Jump for him But but oh Okay, okay, I ran into it. I ran into it boys. Oh, that's that's a lot of damage. That's a lot of damage back up back up back up He's coming for me, bro. He knows he knows who the threat is. Uh-oh. Okay. All right phase one is done Um This is fine. I'm gonna revive and I'm gonna be somebody even better. All right, whatever. Let's see. Let's just see what it is. Okay I mean it's not really the best Can he do can he do the thing? Okay I think we might be losing this guy pretty soon, but well we'll give it a go, bro We'll give it a go. Boys all we can do is hope this guy does a lot of damage for some reason use the thing Use the thing Okay go I don't have a dodge every time I dodge he does he does the attack Um, oh Why did I do that? I mean I have the shield the shield actually seems it pretty good honestly It could be worse. Oh, he seems to kind of be cheesy in a bit by staying in between his legs I just need you to not get hit by that I Almost jumped directly into it. The thing do the thing do the thing Shields. Oh my god. Yes More of that please now. Did this is bonkers go. Oh Oh my god All right, let's see who we get a no-way, bro. Wait, we about to have a mirror match. Does this take up mana or no? It seems like we have infinite mana to be honest. All right bro, what's up? What's up? Okay, that's good damage. I'm literally you don't want to mage that all bro. All right, uh Bing bling bling bling bling bling and then This spinning weapons actually kind of sick and we're just gonna spread straight the whole way wait I've just learned some tech But if I go like bang bang we start TP and bro. Yeah, what's good, bro? Zap zap zap zap okay, there wasn't too much damage yet. We're kind of rocking him Go go go go he's on me. He's eating me. He's eating me Okay, he used to use this use this use the spinny blade thing Um never mind I guess oh That was a boss do we get around him go apparently not I don't know if it bugged or it just doesn't count him as A main boss, but that's that's kind of that makes sense I guess all right. Let's roll out. Um me v me Let's go all right hit him with the thing The wise is harder than it normally is make just kill him all at this point like oh Okay, lock on to her. No the boss Oh, this is the worst okay, that was that was huge. I'm actually get it off that time. All right. There should be it There should be it. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. Let's face one Um Okay rough start. This is kind of sick though The wizard battle popping off. Oh, I would have dodged that personally Up to you though. I guess let's try one of these. Oh, I'm right in the middle of that. Yeah. All right. Let's hope that hits her Okay, it did uh go go go spells That's bad. That's bad. That was bad. That was bad. Oh Oh my god Okay, she just took it to the chest Jesus for a second. I was kind of worried. That was kind of sick though, but I'm glad we got run out early Because she was not kind of stand up to the likes of uh Some bosses coming up. All right. Let's see who we get another boss defeated bell bearing hunter Yeah Okay, I don't know how strong this is going to be, but we do look kind of we look kind of good. All right, so this guy can swing He can Do this It looks a little buggy Um But it's it's pretty there's pretty cool. I think we're gonna go through the ravine. All right run pass that guy And then we go up this we are so large. I do not want to fall off. All right. Let's give this a go Oh, there he is. Oh, okay Okay, okay, how much damage are we doing? We're doing an okay amount. All right and go That was huge. I think that's what makes us so strong is this guy is just the fact that we uh Knock him down over and over That is what's up. Uh, let's see if that counts as a boss Apparently not all right. We'll keep it rolling. I just keep it pushing boys. Uh, no. Thank you. No. Thank you. No. Thank you I'm not dealing with that. All right. Let's charge up one of these Okay We got the stack. He's just got health on health though easy dodge Not so easy dodge. Oh, I hate this guy. I hate this guy. I think we can easily get another knock He will heal That was a little embarrassing that if we get a character that's even worse. I We might be cooked we might be finished Okay Oh, it's omen king as well. So he got the He got the blade on him so I can just keep spamming that and he'll just he'll just go He'll just go silly with it if I just keep going. I just get a revenge.
